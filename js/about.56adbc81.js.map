It was when I had just finished O-levels and was waiting\n          for the results to come out. So basically, in this job, we had to interact with customers who were there to buy\n          Christmas trees, get their order and schedule their orders to their house. We also handled communications with \n          the delivery staff and had to coordinate their deliveries based on both delivery date and area. \n        </p>\n        <p><b>Skills Learned:</b>Effective Communication, Sales,Patience in working with a team</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-4\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/jm.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"experience row\">\n        <div class=\"col-8\">\n        <h3>National Service</h3>\n        <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> SAF</p>\n        <p><b>Role:</b> Driver</p>\n        <p><b>Duration:</b> 2019-2021</p>\n        <p>During my national service, I was a driver for 1st transport Alpha company. Our company was incharge of moving\n          bullets and transporting vehincles using low loaders. Due to our specialisation even amongst other transport \n          company, it made my national service more rewarding, fun and even scary at times. We were trained not just in\n          class 3 but also class 4 and class 4a vehicles. Initially, it was very scary to drive such a huge vehicle on \n          the road espicially knowing that 1. You could easily collide with another car if you are not too careful and 2.\n          if we do get into a traffic accident, it could be a huge catostraphe due to the live ordinance that we were carrying.\n          It took me awhile to get over this fear and only through many trial and error was I finally confident enough to \n          drive the low loader. \n        </p>\n        <p><b>Skills Learned:</b>Teamwork, Attention to detail, Problem Solving</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-4\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/army.jpeg\" class=\"round-image\" >\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"experience row\">\n        <div class=\"col-8\">\n        <h3>M1 digital ambassador</h3>\n        <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> M1 Pte Ltd</p>\n        <p><b>Role:</b> Digital ambassador</p>\n        <p><b>Duration:</b>Feb 2021 - May 2021</p>\n        <p>So this was the job that I took on after I finished my national service. In this job, I was tasked with teaching\n          M1 customers on how to use their phone, digital app and also in charge of dispensing a queue ticket for their \n          enquiries. I was the first line of contact for anyone that walks into a M1 shop. This job was particularly\n          challenging as often times I had to communicate with elderly or people who are less techincally saavy, and\n          in most cases, it often takes quite alot of patience to teach them how to do things. I was also tasked with\n          managing queue times, by ensuring that queries that did not need to be raised to counter staff were resolved \n          so as to not make queutimes unnecessarily long. \n        </p>\n        <p><b>Skills:</b>Patience, Tech literacy, Effective communication in multiple languages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-4\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/m1.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\n      </div>\n      </div>\n      <!-- Experience 2 -->\n      <div class=\"experience row\">\n        <div class=\"col-8\">\n        <h3>Samsung Mobile Phone Promoter</h3>\n        <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> Samsung</p>\n        <p><b>Role:</b> Mobile Phone promoter</p>\n        <p><b>Duration:</b>May 2021 - Aug 2024</p>\n        <p>This was my longest job that I ever had. So my job was to promote to customers Samsung mobile phone products.\n          This job was made easier espicially because of the fact that my previous job was working in a Telco company, it\n          meant that I had many transferable skills like being able to converse effectively in both English and Mandaring\n          about this topic, being very literate espicially when it came to mobile phones and also I was experienced in\n          working with many difficult customers\n\n        </p>\n        <p><b>Skills:</b>Customer service, Sales</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-4\">\n        <img src=\"../assets/samsung.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\n      </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <!-- Experience 3 -->\n      <div class=\"experience row\">\n        <div class=\"col-8\">\n        <h3>SMU student services hub</h3>\n        <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> SMU</p>\n        <p><b>Role:</b> Student advisor</p>\n        <p><b>Duration:</b> Dec 2023- Now</p>\n        <p>This is my current job that I have held for almost the past year.

It was when I had just finished O-levels and was waiting\r\n            for the results to come out. So basically, in this job, we had to interact with customers who were there to buy\r\n            Christmas trees, get their order and schedule their orders to their house. We also handled communications with \r\n            the delivery staff and had to coordinate their deliveries based on both delivery date and area. \r\n          </p>\r\n          <p><b>Skills Learned:</b>Effective Communication, Sales,Patience in working with a team</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-4\">\r\n          <img src=\"../assets/logo.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"experience row\">\r\n          <div class=\"col-8\">\r\n          <h3>National Service</h3>\r\n          <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> SAF</p>\r\n          <p><b>Role:</b> Driver</p>\r\n          <p><b>Duration:</b> 2019-2021</p>\r\n          <p>During my national service, I was a driver for 1st transport Alpha company. Our company was incharge of moving\r\n            bullets and transporting vehincles using low loaders. Due to our specialisation even amongst other transport \r\n            company, it made my national service more rewarding, fun and even scary at times. We were trained not just in\r\n            class 3 but also class 4 and class 4a vehicles. Initially, it was very scary to drive such a huge vehicle on \r\n            the road espicially knowing that 1. You could easily collide with another car if you are not too careful and 2.\r\n            if we do get into a traffic accident, it could be a huge catostraphe due to the live ordinance that we were carrying.\r\n            It took me awhile to get over this fear and only through many trial and error was I finally confident enough to \r\n            drive the low loader. \r\n          </p>\r\n          <p><b>Skills Learned:</b>Teamwork, Attention to detail, Problem Solving</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-4\">\r\n          <img src=\"../assets/logo.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"experience row\">\r\n          <div class=\"col-8\">\r\n          <h3>M1 digital ambassador</h3>\r\n          <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> M1 Pte Ltd</p>\r\n          <p><b>Role:</b> Digital ambassador</p>\r\n          <p><b>Duration:</b>Feb 2021 - May 2021</p>\r\n          <p>So this was the job that I took on after I finished my national service. In this job, I was tasked with teaching\r\n            M1 customers on how to use their phone, digital app and also in charge of dispensing a queue ticket for their \r\n            enquiries. I was the first line of contact for anyone that walks into a M1 shop. This job was particularly\r\n            challenging as often times I had to communicate with elderly or people who are less techincally saavy, and\r\n            in most cases, it often takes quite alot of patience to teach them how to do things. I was also tasked with\r\n            managing queue times, by ensuring that queries that did not need to be raised to counter staff were resolved \r\n            so as to not make queutimes unnecessarily long. \r\n          </p>\r\n          <p><b>Skills:</b>Patience, Tech literacy, Effective communication in multiple languages</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-4\">\r\n          <img src=\"../assets/logo.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <!-- Experience 2 -->\r\n        <div class=\"experience row\">\r\n          <div class=\"col-8\">\r\n          <h3>Samsung Mobile Phone Promoter</h3>\r\n          <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> Samsung</p>\r\n          <p><b>Role:</b> Mobile Phone promoter</p>\r\n          <p><b>Duration:</b>May 2021 - Aug 2024</p>\r\n          <p>This was my longest job that I ever had. So my job was to promote to customers Samsung mobile phone products.\r\n            This job was made easier espicially because of the fact that my previous job was working in a Telco company, it\r\n            meant that I had many transferable skills like being able to converse effectively in both English and Mandaring\r\n            about this topic, being very literate espicially when it came to mobile phones and also I was experienced in\r\n            working with many difficult customers\r\n  \r\n          </p>\r\n          <p><b>Skills:</b>Customer service, Sales</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-4\">\r\n          <img src=\"../assets/logo.png\" class=\"round-image\" >\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n  \r\n        <!-- Experience 3 -->\r\n        <div class=\"experience row\">\r\n          <div class=\"col-8\">\r\n          <h3>SMU student services hub</h3>\r\n          <p><b>Company/Organization:</b> SMU</p>\r\n          <p><b>Role:</b> Student advisor</p>\r\n          <p><b>Duration:</b> Dec 2023- Now</p>\r\n          <p>This is my current job that I have held for almost the past year.
